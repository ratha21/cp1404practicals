i have started putting in more time to python and trying diffrent functions to help me get better at it then rather
going 

i need to start looking at the erros been made and start to try solving them myself rather then going to chatgpt and gettint it to fix my errors made

tryimg diffrent methods tro approach functions and problems then just going by the book be more  creative with my answers

i need to change my attitude of finding and thinking its tough and ignoring the question rather then trying to understand and face it 

the one change is the suddenl solving of questions during class its very scary to be put on the spot without knowing your gonna be questioned
