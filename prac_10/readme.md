How was your estimate accuracy usually?
In the beginning, my estimates were often inaccurate. I either underestimated the time a task would take, especially when debugging or understanding new concepts, or overestimated simple tasks.

How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?
Over time, my estimates became more accurate as I became more familiar with the style of the practicals, the tools involved, and how long common tasks like testing or debugging typically take. I also learned to factor in time for unexpected issues.

What did you learn from doing these estimates?
I learned how to better break tasks into smaller components and estimate time more realistically. It also helped me plan my workload better and avoid last-minute stress.

What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?
I learned how valuable outside perspectives are. Reviewers often spotted small logic flaws or offered simpler, more Pythonic solutions that I hadn't thought of.

What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?
Reviewing others helped reinforce my understanding of coding standards and good practices. It made me more attentive to naming conventions, readability, and the importance of comments and docstrings.

Good Code Reviews
Good Code Review 1
Explanation:
In this review, I provided specific, constructive feedback on variable naming and function separation. I pointed out a few areas that could be cleaned up and added a suggestion to add docstrings for better clarity. I also highlighted what they did well, like their use of loops and input validation.

Good Code Review 2
Explanation:
This review focused on testability and formatting. I suggested improvements to unit test structure and mentioned potential edge cases that werenâ€™t considered. I also gave praise where it was due for their consistent indentation and comments.

Regarding the practical tasks overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?
I would include short walkthrough videos or interactive examples for harder pracs (e.g., Flask or Kivy) since those were conceptually more complex. Some parts could benefit from visual guidance alongside the instructions.

What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?
I stayed consistent with submitting on time, improved my testing practices, and ensured my code was clean, readable, and well-commented. I also contributed meaningfully to code reviews and improved in giving and receiving feedback.
